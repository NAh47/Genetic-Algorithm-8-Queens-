# Genetic-Algorithm-8-Queens-
This program utilizes a genetic algorithm to solve for a solution in a randomly generated configuration of 8 queens, which is represented as a 1D array with columns as indexes and the array elements indicating the row location of the queens. Initially, the program creates a specified number of populations consisting of randomly generated configurations. The fitness value of each configuration is measured and based on their proportional fitness, two parents are selected for breeding. The program then creates offspring by crossing over and mutating the selected parents. This process is repeated until a solution is found or a predetermined number of iterations have been reached. Finally, the average fitness value of each generation is plotted against the number of generations.
